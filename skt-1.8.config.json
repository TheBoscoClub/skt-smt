    SafeKeyboardTester Configuration File (skt-1.8.config.json)

    What is this file?
    -----------------
    This is a configuration file in JSON format that controls how the SafeKeyboardTester
    behaves. Think of it as a list of settings or preferences that tell the program
    exactly how to simulate keyboard input.

    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's a common way to store settings
    in a format that both humans and computers can read. In JSON:
    - Settings are organized as "key": "value" pairs
    - Keys are always in quotes and followed by a colon
    - Text values are in quotes
    - Number values don't need quotes
    - Lists are in square brackets [ ]
    - Groups of related settings are in curly braces { }

    For new JSON users:
    ------------------
    - Commas separate each setting, but there's no comma after the last item in a list
      or the last setting in a group
    - Indentation isn't required but makes the file easier to read
    - The file must be correctly formatted for the program to read it
